# v22 Ada Library User Manual

**This repository contains preliminary releases**

## Introduction

v22 is a general purpose, KISS oriented, modular Ada framework for GNU/Linux Debian/Ubuntu2 service, console and web programs.

v22 is composed of many packages in charge of UTF-8 strings, program and OS functions, HTTP(s)/WS(s) web framework, integrated cURL, console handling and text files, advanced network, MySQL and SQLite high level binding, logging and configuration files handling. 

Originally based on the v20 library, the v22 framework represents a major step forward in the following areas:
- UTF-8 compatibility;
- Simplified string processing (only one UTF-8 String type is used);
- Internationalization;
- New and extended database API;
- Extended database access to MySQL, in addition to SQLite;
- Improved concurrent access and performance for SQLite;
- New LGPLv3 licensing instead of GPLv3;
- New FSF GCC development environment not tied anymore to GPLv2 licence; 
- And much more.
